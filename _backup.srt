1
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,900
Go, Eren!
You are the best :))

2
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:31,760
In the year 850...

3
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,679
For the first time,

4
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,840
humanity recovered part of its
territory from the Titans.

5
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,530
Though at great cost.

6
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:49,300
Then I welcome everyone
here to the Survey Corps!

7
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,640
This is a true salute!

8
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,390
Offer up your hearts!

9
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,320
Yes, sir!

10
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:02,660
You have done well to endure your fear.

11
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,570
You are brave soldiers.

12
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:07,980
You have my heartfelt respect.

13
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:10,990
A month later,

14
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:15,039
led by Erwin Smith, the
Survey Corps left Karanes

15
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,489
to find a route to Zhiganshina,

16
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:22,540
where it's believed the secrets
of the Titans are held.

17
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:31,300
We will now begin the 57th
expedition beyond the walls!

18
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:34,140
Onward!

20
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:11,980
Female Titan
57th Expedition Beyond the Walls (1)

21
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,380
Ahead, to the left, a 10-meter class!

22
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,260
I am very interested in seeing
what's inside its stomach...

23
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,760
But I'll leave it to the support team!

24
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:44,890
Damn!

25
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,390
Not deep enough.

26
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,900
Defend the formation!

27
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,440
Stay strong!

28
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,830
Leave it to the support
team, and keep going!

29
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:02,950
Onward! Onward!

30
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:10,960
The support teams will only
accompany us to the old city area.

31
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:14,400
Once we're past that,
it's completely Titan territory.

32
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:20,220
The long-range scouting formation devised
by Commander Erwin is our only hope.

33
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,610
We, the special ops squad, are here.

34
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:28,260
Sir, can they...

35
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,150
Can my classmates beat the Titans?

36
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:32,520
Huh?

37
00:04:32,521 --> 00:04:35,670
What have you been doing the past month?

38
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:38,939
Listen, brat...

39
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,699
The most crucial part

40
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,320
of an expedition is in how
you avoid fighting Titansâ€"

41
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,170
Go into long-range scouting formation!

42
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,680
See ya, Armin.

43
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,050
If you run into a Titan,
don't piss your pants!

44
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:02,639
Right!

45
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,780
Same to you, Jean.

46
00:05:10,406 --> 00:05:11,916
Row 3-3: Relay

47
00:05:11,941 --> 00:05:13,550
The vanguard is to spread
out in a semi-circle.

48
00:05:13,575 --> 00:05:17,215
But stay within visual
range of one another.

49
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,760
Row 5-Center: Standby

50
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:20,585
Position yourselves at fixed intervals.

51
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:24,670
Extend the recon and message relay
range as far as possible.

52
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,280
We'll be fine...

53
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:51,610
Calm down!

54
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:00,660
It's primarily the forward recon squad
that will encounter Titans.

55
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,700
As soon as one is sighted,
they'll fire a red smoke round.

56
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:19,110
Anyone who sees the flare should fire
the same round to relay the signal.

57
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:26,179
When the Commander sees it,

58
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,140
he'll fire a green smoke round,

59
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:32,770
and show the formation where to go.

60
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:39,519
Thus, the entire formation can advance

61
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,860
toward the goal, while avoiding Titans.

62
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:48,989
But sometimes, due to terrain or obstacles,

63
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:52,120
a Titan won't be sighted until
it's within the formation.

64
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,459
Red... Red...

65
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,920
Red smoke round...

66
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,800
Blause! Over here!

67
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:12,669
Damn it! Did we let one through?

68
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:14,060
We'll draw it this way.

69
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:16,440
Blause, get over here!

70
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,240
I'll handle it!

71
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,190
Split off!

72
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,160
Yes, sir!

73
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,719
Sir...

74
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,010
Back into position!

75
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,770
He ran out of gas.

76
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,610
Something's wrong...

77
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,369
It's been a while since we
saw the red smoke round,

78
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:03,980
but they still haven't reformed.

79
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:05,490
It can't be...

80
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:09,909
Note that this strategy only
works on normal Titans,

81
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:13,240
whose behavior can be easily predicted.

82
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,660
A black smoke round?

83
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,009
Is a Titan ignoring the nearby humans

84
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:22,210
and heading for the formation's center?

85
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,000
It has to be...

86
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:25,590
That's

87
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,190
an Aberrant!

88
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:32,849
It's only necessary to fight Aberrants,

89
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:34,509
whose behavior is unpredictable.

90
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:37,099
Damn, we'll have to fight it...

91
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,940
Sys, go for the neck!

92
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,899
I'll stop it!

93
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,230
Roger!

94
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:47,319
Using Maneuver Gear on flat
terrain is a huge disadvantage.

95
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,320
It almost never works.

96
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,480
But I can't let it disrupt the formation.

97
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:55,979
I think that's Arlert over there.

98
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,810
I don't want one of the
new guys to run into it.

99
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:00,370
We kill it here!

100
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,130
Now, Sys!

101
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,270
You did it, Squad Leader Ness!

102
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:23,190
Did I get him?

103
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:26,429
You came for me?

104
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:28,370
That's my partner...

105
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:31,670
I love you, Shallot!

106
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:40,990
Again?

107
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:43,959
What is the right flank recon squad doing?

108
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,869
If it ignored them and came this way,

109
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,620
it must be another Aberrant.

110
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:49,940
Oh, fine...

111
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,009
Sys, we do it again.

112
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:53,800
Right.

113
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,310
But we've got the worst luck,
doing this twice in a row...

114
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,370
And I think it's at least
a fourteen-meter class.

115
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,390
This one will be tough.

116
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,209
What's that?

117
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:15,370
It's too fast!

118
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:17,329
Don't let it reach Arlert!

119
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:18,030
Sys!

120
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:19,570
Right!

121
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:56,280
No... No.

122
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,920
That's no Aberrant.

123
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,620
It's intelligent!

124
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,850
Like the Armored or
Colossal Titans, or Eren...

125
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:05,830
A human in the body of a Titan!

126
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:07,330
B-But who?

127
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,840
Why?

128
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,800
This is bad! What should I do?

129
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,969
I'm going to die, too...

130
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:12,880
I'll be killed!

131
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:16,380
Go! Run!

132
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,310
What does it...

133
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,810
No, what do they...

134
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,980
What do they want?

135
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,050
Someone tell them...

136
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:56,170
That the right flank recon squad
has been wiped out...

137
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:01,450
A Female Titan brought
a huge Titan army!

138
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:05,560
Is anyone there?

139
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,160
It's not going to kill me?

140
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:07,840
Why?

141
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,040
It removed my hood...

142
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:15,740
To... To look at my face?

143
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:17,310
Armin!

144
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,570
Reiner!

145
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,300
Hey, can you stand?

146
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,589
You won't last outside the walls
unless you're on horseback...

147
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:28,590
Hurry!

148
00:13:28,591 --> 00:13:29,630
Right!

149
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:34,519
I saw the smoke round
signaling an Aberrant.

150
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,969
Was it that one there with the nice ass?

151
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:38,549
That's no Aberrant...

152
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:40,600
It's a human in a Titan body!

153
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,100
What was that?

154
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:44,369
Wait a second.

155
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:45,900
We need to fire a smoke round first.

156
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,500
H-Hurry...

157
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,550
There's an emergency over there.

158
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,110
With a smoke round, I'll...

159
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:55,330
Wait... I think Jean fired it.

160
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,439
It came from the right flank.

161
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,290
Does that mean we're so compromised,
we can't continue the mission?

162
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,589
Looks like the right flank recon
squad was partially wiped out...

163
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:08,679
Titans, tons of them.

164
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,920
I don't know why,

165
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:13,049
but there are lots of fast ones.

166
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:14,859
For now, we're holding them back,

167
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,760
but recon is no longer possible...

168
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,869
We've taken heavy losses,

169
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,670
and if we aren't careful,
we'll be destroyed!

170
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,310
That Titan came from the same direction.

171
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:24,730
No way...

172
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:27,410
Was it leading the Titans?

173
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,030
It?

174
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,030
Why is a Titan over there?

175
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:33,500
An Aberrant?

176
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:39,499
No, it's a human in a Titan body...

177
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,620
Someone with the same ability as Eren.

178
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,370
What?

179
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,060
Why do you think that, Armin?

180
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,840
The Titans only eat us.

181
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:52,519
We're just killed in the process.

182
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,800
Killing us isn't ever
specifically their goal.

183
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:58,060
But when Sys aimed for its weak spot,

184
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,520
it crushed him and smashed
him into the ground.

185
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:06,340
It killed him to kill,
rather than to eat him.

186
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,070
Its nature is different from the others.

187
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:13,629
When the Colossal and Armored
Titans destroyed the walls,

188
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:17,330
it must've been the one that
brought that army of Titans.

189
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:21,130
Their goal has consistently
been to attack all humanity!

190
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,580
No, maybe not.

191
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:27,720
It felt like it was looking for someone...

192
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,970
If that is the case,
could it be looking for...

193
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,760
Could it be looking for Eren?

194
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:35,799
Eren?

195
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:40,300
Eren's with Squad Levi, which is
in charge of the right flank.

196
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,230
The right flank?

197
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:46,870
The plans I got had them
to the rear of the left flank.

198
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:52,800
Mine said they were near
the front of the right...

199
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:56,240
Wait, there's no way they'd
be on the front lines.

200
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,120
So where are they?

201
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:02,800
Probably the safest place in the formation.

202
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:07,790
Which means in the center,
and toward the rear...

203
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,250
Armin!

204
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:12,010
There's no time to think.

205
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:15,510
Smoke rounds can't possibly indicate
how much of a threat it poses!

206
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,529
At this rate, it'll wipe out command.

207
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:21,739
Then the formation will fall apart,
and that'll be the end.

208
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,100
What are you trying to say?

209
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:24,959
In other words,

210
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,830
at this range, we may still be
able to draw its attention.

211
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,550
We may be able to buy time to withdraw.

212
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:35,280
Maybe... Maybe...

213
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,990
But it really is intelligent.

214
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:43,949
To it, we are nothing but
insignificant insects.

215
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:46,040
It'll just crush us...

216
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,560
Seriously?

217
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:50,540
That's scary...

218
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:53,829
Hey, are you really Jean?

219
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:58,050
The Jean I know never thinks
of anyone but himself.

220
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,590
Don't be an ass...

221
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:07,350
I just don't want those charred bones I saw

222
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,840
to be disappointed in me!

223
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,640
I...

224
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:16,040
I know what I have to do now!

225
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:19,299
And this is the job we chose.

226
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,490
Help me!

227
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,689
Put on your hood.

228
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:28,809
As far forward as you can...

229
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:30,830
So that your face is hidden from it.

230
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:35,779
I don't think it will kill us until
it knows who we are!

231
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:36,960
Oh...

232
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:40,770
You believe if it thinks we might
be Eren, it won't kill us?

233
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:43,349
If nothing else, it'll make me feel better.

234
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:46,470
Let's just hope it has poor eyesight!

235
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:52,710
Armin, I thought it was creepy
how you always clung to Eren.

236
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:54,830
But I've always thought you had it in you.

237
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:57,570
Uh, thanks.

238
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,820
But "creepy"? That's really mean...

239
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:18,170
It's going much more slowly
than when I first saw it.

240
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:19,730
Is it tired?

241
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:23,150
If it runs at that speed
again, we'll be too late!

242
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:26,390
Now's our chance... We have to do it now!

243
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:35,520
Listen up... Remember what I said.

244
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:38,799
Try to draw its attention
for as long as possible,

245
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,169
to give the formation time to withdraw!

246
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:43,380
Keep it here as long as you can.

247
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:47,530
If we could cut its Achilles tendon,
that'd be more than enough.

248
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:50,449
But don't do anything stupid...

249
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:51,850
Don't try to kill it!

250
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:55,080
It's aware of the weak spot on its neck.

251
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:57,849
It's totally different than other Titans...

252
00:18:57,850 --> 00:18:59,440
It is impossible to kill.

253
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:04,070
At least, not by any normal human being.

254
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,430
However...

255
00:19:08,431 --> 00:19:10,690
If it's those two... Maybe...

256
00:19:52,037 --> 00:19:52,897
Armin!

257
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,509
This one...

258
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:58,809
Its movements are much more
precise than the others' are!

259
00:19:58,810 --> 00:19:59,899
Damn it.

260
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:00,990
I...

261
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:03,160
I underestimated it!

262
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,130
It protected its neck...

263
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,090
Jean!

264
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:14,960
Damn it! I can't get away!

265
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,220
I'm going to die!

266
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,590
Once it grasps my wire, it's over!

267
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:23,019
Jean!

268
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:26,010
Avenge the bastard who rushed to his death!

269
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,510
Armin?

270
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,210
It stopped?

271
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,789
That's the one...

272
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:34,539
That's the one that killed him!

273
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:37,339
He rushed to his death on the right flank!

274
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:39,730
Avenge him!

275
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:47,550
What happened?

276
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,399
Did Armin hit his head and go insane?

277
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,120
This isn't the time...

278
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:54,650
R-Reiner?

279
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,370
It crushed my best friend!

280
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:01,330
I saw his body under its foot!

281
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,210
He's going straight for the neck?

282
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,879
No, it's working!

283
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,550
While it's distracted by Armin!

284
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:20,260
H-Hey...

285
00:21:33,253 --> 00:21:36,693
H-Hey... Reiner, you...

286
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:56,050
Reiner did it!

287
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,709
Mikasa was so strong, I forgot.

288
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:01,890
But he's really strong and reliable, too...

289
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,819
We've bought enough time, right?

290
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,480
Let's get the hell away from it!

291
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,730
If it isn't a man-eater,
it won't follow us!

292
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,189
Look...

293
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:24,490
That big bitch got scared
and decided to go home!

294
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:27,330
No... Why?

295
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:30,070
That's toward the center rear.

296
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,650
Is it

297
00:22:32,363 --> 00:22:34,083
heading toward Eren?

298
00:22:35,133 --> 00:22:38,329

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go, Eren!
You are the best :))

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In the year 850...

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For the first time,

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
humanity recovered part of its
territory from the Titans.

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Though at great cost.

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,596
Then I welcome everyone
here to the Survey Corps!

7
00:00:04,787 --> 00:00:06,727
This is a true salute!

8
00:00:08,238 --> 00:00:09,618
Offer up your hearts!

9
00:00:13,094 --> 00:00:14,154
Yes, sir!

10
00:00:20,818 --> 00:00:23,048
You have done well to endure your fear.

11
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:27,465
You are brave soldiers.

12
00:00:29,603 --> 00:00:31,273
You have my heartfelt respect.

13
00:00:34,652 --> 00:00:35,952
A month later,

14
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:41,019
led by Erwin Smith, the
Survey Corps left Karanes

15
00:00:42,645 --> 00:00:45,094
to find a route to Zhiganshina,

16
00:00:46,306 --> 00:00:51,356
where it's believed the secrets
of the Titans are held.

17
00:01:02,172 --> 00:01:05,362
We will now begin the 57th
expedition beyond the walls!

18
00:01:08,567 --> 00:01:10,317
Onward!

20
00:03:29,946 --> 00:03:34,906
Female Titan
57th Expedition Beyond the Walls (1)

21
00:04:07,356 --> 00:04:09,676
Ahead, to the left, a 10-meter class!

22
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:14,885
I am very interested in seeing
what's inside its stomach...

23
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:19,480
But I'll leave it to the support team!

24
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:26,149
Damn!

25
00:04:27,212 --> 00:04:28,252
Not deep enough.

26
00:04:29,946 --> 00:04:31,666
Defend the formation!

27
00:04:38,865 --> 00:04:40,155
Stay strong!

28
00:04:41,091 --> 00:04:43,281
Leave it to the support
team, and keep going!

29
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:51,610
Onward! Onward!

30
00:05:01,096 --> 00:05:04,026
The support teams will only
accompany us to the old city area.

31
00:05:05,997 --> 00:05:09,087
Once we're past that,
it's completely Titan territory.

32
00:05:11,211 --> 00:05:16,631
The long-range scouting formation devised
by Commander Erwin is our only hope.

33
00:05:20,354 --> 00:05:23,044
We, the special ops squad, are here.

34
00:05:28,288 --> 00:05:30,318
Sir, can they...

35
00:05:32,456 --> 00:05:34,586
Can my classmates beat the Titans?

36
00:05:36,266 --> 00:05:37,216
Huh?

37
00:05:37,686 --> 00:05:40,835
What have you been doing the past month?

38
00:05:44,363 --> 00:05:46,312
Listen, brat...

39
00:05:47,277 --> 00:05:49,036
The most crucial part

40
00:05:49,906 --> 00:05:52,526
of an expedition is in how
you avoid fighting Titansâ€"

41
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,820
Go into long-range scouting formation!

42
00:06:13,093 --> 00:06:14,553
See ya, Armin.

43
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:19,040
If you run into a Titan,
don't piss your pants!

44
00:06:21,146 --> 00:06:22,175
Right!

45
00:06:22,685 --> 00:06:23,825
Same to you, Jean.

46
00:06:34,287 --> 00:06:35,797
Row 3-3: Relay

47
00:06:36,581 --> 00:06:38,190
The vanguard is to spread
out in a semi-circle.

48
00:06:39,022 --> 00:06:42,662
But stay within visual
range of one another.

49
00:06:44,498 --> 00:06:46,018
Row 5-Center: Standby

50
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:48,606
Position yourselves at fixed intervals.

51
00:06:49,532 --> 00:06:53,592
Extend the recon and message relay
range as far as possible.

52
00:07:32,306 --> 00:07:33,346
We'll be fine...

53
00:07:34,323 --> 00:07:35,343
Calm down!

54
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:47,095
It's primarily the forward recon squad
that will encounter Titans.

55
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:03,619
As soon as one is sighted,
they'll fire a red smoke round.

56
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:14,833
Anyone who sees the flare should fire
the same round to relay the signal.

57
00:08:22,655 --> 00:08:25,894
When the Commander sees it,

58
00:08:27,495 --> 00:08:29,455
he'll fire a green smoke round,

59
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:35,810
and show the formation where to go.

60
00:08:40,329 --> 00:08:45,078
Thus, the entire formation can advance

61
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:49,766
toward the goal, while avoiding Titans.

62
00:08:55,075 --> 00:08:59,424
But sometimes, due to terrain or obstacles,

63
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:04,704
a Titan won't be sighted until
it's within the formation.

64
00:09:16,365 --> 00:09:17,934
Red... Red...

65
00:09:18,711 --> 00:09:20,171
Red smoke round...

66
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:28,847
Blause! Over here!

67
00:09:33,247 --> 00:09:35,726
Damn it! Did we let one through?

68
00:09:36,953 --> 00:09:38,343
We'll draw it this way.

69
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:41,661
Blause, get over here!

70
00:09:58,750 --> 00:09:59,730
I'll handle it!

71
00:10:00,214 --> 00:10:01,164
Split off!

72
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:02,604
Yes, sir!

73
00:10:30,424 --> 00:10:31,683
Sir...

74
00:10:32,306 --> 00:10:33,596
Back into position!

75
00:10:34,637 --> 00:10:36,127
He ran out of gas.

76
00:10:44,706 --> 00:10:46,296
Something's wrong...

77
00:10:47,575 --> 00:10:50,004
It's been a while since we
saw the red smoke round,

78
00:10:51,205 --> 00:10:52,815
but they still haven't reformed.

79
00:10:54,343 --> 00:10:55,363
It can't be...

80
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,879
Note that this strategy only
works on normal Titans,

81
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:05,800
whose behavior can be easily predicted.

82
00:11:11,808 --> 00:11:13,308
A black smoke round?

83
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:16,709
Is a Titan ignoring the nearby humans

84
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,760
and heading for the formation's center?

85
00:11:21,967 --> 00:11:23,007
It has to be...

86
00:11:24,193 --> 00:11:25,333
That's

87
00:11:27,824 --> 00:11:29,134
an Aberrant!

88
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:35,270
It's only necessary to fight Aberrants,

89
00:11:36,743 --> 00:11:38,402
whose behavior is unpredictable.

90
00:11:39,223 --> 00:11:41,812
Damn, we'll have to fight it...

91
00:11:43,093 --> 00:11:44,933
Sys, go for the neck!

92
00:11:46,649 --> 00:11:48,068
I'll stop it!

93
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:50,100
Roger!

94
00:11:53,596 --> 00:11:56,785
Using Maneuver Gear on flat
terrain is a huge disadvantage.

95
00:11:58,362 --> 00:12:00,362
It almost never works.

96
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:04,688
But I can't let it disrupt the formation.

97
00:12:07,371 --> 00:12:10,000
I think that's Arlert over there.

98
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,130
I don't want one of the
new guys to run into it.

99
00:12:16,126 --> 00:12:17,286
We kill it here!

100
00:12:30,677 --> 00:12:31,857
Now, Sys!

101
00:12:42,913 --> 00:12:45,043
You did it, Squad Leader Ness!

102
00:12:50,219 --> 00:12:51,379
Did I get him?

103
00:12:54,821 --> 00:12:56,140
You came for me?

104
00:12:56,793 --> 00:12:58,733
That's my partner...

105
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:03,406
I love you, Shallot!

106
00:13:17,022 --> 00:13:18,042
Again?

107
00:13:19,114 --> 00:13:21,703
What is the right flank recon squad doing?

108
00:13:22,983 --> 00:13:24,892
If it ignored them and came this way,

109
00:13:25,837 --> 00:13:27,587
it must be another Aberrant.

110
00:13:29,751 --> 00:13:31,201
Oh, fine...

111
00:13:33,621 --> 00:13:35,550
Sys, we do it again.

112
00:13:36,504 --> 00:13:37,294
Right.

113
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:42,669
But we've got the worst luck,
doing this twice in a row...

114
00:13:45,244 --> 00:13:47,754
And I think it's at least
a fourteen-meter class.

115
00:13:49,517 --> 00:13:51,187
This one will be tough.

116
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:07,579
What's that?

117
00:14:08,177 --> 00:14:09,337
It's too fast!

118
00:14:10,209 --> 00:14:11,968
Don't let it reach Arlert!

119
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:13,539
Sys!

120
00:14:14,631 --> 00:14:15,671
Right!

121
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,880
No... No.

122
00:15:11,718 --> 00:15:12,898
That's no Aberrant.

123
00:15:14,004 --> 00:15:15,354
It's intelligent!

124
00:15:16,648 --> 00:15:19,458
Like the Armored or
Colossal Titans, or Eren...

125
00:15:21,743 --> 00:15:24,123
A human in the body of a Titan!

126
00:15:26,105 --> 00:15:27,065
B-But who?

127
00:15:28,421 --> 00:15:29,341
Why?

128
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:31,993
This is bad! What should I do?

129
00:15:32,963 --> 00:15:33,972
I'm going to die, too...

130
00:15:34,472 --> 00:15:35,382
I'll be killed!

131
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:40,186
Go! Run!

132
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:53,691
What does it...

133
00:15:57,794 --> 00:16:00,024
No, what do they...

134
00:16:06,056 --> 00:16:07,926
What do they want?

135
00:16:30,124 --> 00:16:31,954
Someone tell them...

136
00:16:34,502 --> 00:16:38,522
That the right flank recon squad
has been wiped out...

137
00:16:41,524 --> 00:16:46,124
A Female Titan brought
a huge Titan army!

138
00:16:50,757 --> 00:16:53,287
Is anyone there?

139
00:18:21,698 --> 00:18:23,958
It's not going to kill me?

140
00:18:25,762 --> 00:18:26,982
Why?

141
00:18:29,377 --> 00:18:31,377
It removed my hood...

142
00:18:32,933 --> 00:18:37,253
To... To look at my face?

143
00:18:40,418 --> 00:18:41,298
Armin!

144
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,590
Reiner!

145
00:18:46,409 --> 00:18:48,269
Hey, can you stand?

146
00:18:50,293 --> 00:18:54,842
You won't last outside the walls
unless you're on horseback...

147
00:18:57,091 --> 00:18:58,091
Hurry!

148
00:18:58,587 --> 00:18:59,626
Right!

149
00:19:03,486 --> 00:19:06,135
I saw the smoke round
signaling an Aberrant.

150
00:19:07,445 --> 00:19:09,894
Was it that one there with the nice ass?

151
00:19:11,105 --> 00:19:12,684
That's no Aberrant...

152
00:19:13,466 --> 00:19:15,516
It's a human in a Titan body!

153
00:19:17,007 --> 00:19:18,187
What was that?

154
00:19:20,428 --> 00:19:21,587
Wait a second.

155
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,691
We need to fire a smoke round first.

156
00:19:24,985 --> 00:19:26,225
H-Hurry...

157
00:19:27,211 --> 00:19:29,011
There's an emergency over there.

158
00:19:30,617 --> 00:19:31,697
With a smoke round, I'll...

159
00:19:33,874 --> 00:19:36,994
Wait... I think Jean fired it.

160
00:19:43,077 --> 00:19:45,146
It came from the right flank.

161
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:49,020
Does that mean we're so compromised,
we can't continue the mission?

162
00:19:51,115 --> 00:19:53,954
Looks like the right flank recon
squad was partially wiped out...

163
00:19:55,358 --> 00:19:57,447
Titans, tons of them.

164
00:19:58,481 --> 00:19:59,721
I don't know why,

165
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:03,788
but there are lots of fast ones.

166
00:20:05,009 --> 00:20:06,818
For now, we're holding them back,

167
00:20:07,714 --> 00:20:09,614
but recon is no longer possible...

168
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,879
We've taken heavy losses,

169
00:20:13,705 --> 00:20:15,505
and if we aren't careful,
we'll be destroyed!

170
00:20:17,246 --> 00:20:19,316
That Titan came from the same direction.

171
00:20:21,175 --> 00:20:22,035
No way...

172
00:20:23,207 --> 00:20:25,387
Was it leading the Titans?

173
00:20:27,076 --> 00:20:28,286
It?

174
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:32,185
Why is a Titan over there?

175
00:20:34,173 --> 00:20:35,103
An Aberrant?

176
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:41,719
No, it's a human in a Titan body...

177
00:20:44,526 --> 00:20:46,646
Someone with the same ability as Eren.

178
00:20:48,246 --> 00:20:49,626
What?

179
00:20:50,771 --> 00:20:53,151
Why do you think that, Armin?

180
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:58,710
The Titans only eat us.

181
00:21:00,617 --> 00:21:02,866
We're just killed in the process.

182
00:21:03,979 --> 00:21:06,259
Killing us isn't ever
specifically their goal.

183
00:21:08,117 --> 00:21:10,887
But when Sys aimed for its weak spot,

184
00:21:13,062 --> 00:21:15,982
it crushed him and smashed
him into the ground.

185
00:21:19,681 --> 00:21:22,991
It killed him to kill,
rather than to eat him.

186
00:21:25,283 --> 00:21:27,573
Its nature is different from the others.

187
00:21:29,691 --> 00:21:33,590
When the Colossal and Armored
Titans destroyed the walls,

188
00:21:35,517 --> 00:21:39,217
it must've been the one that
brought that army of Titans.

189
00:21:41,942 --> 00:21:45,142
Their goal has consistently
been to attack all humanity!

190
00:21:49,337 --> 00:21:51,037
No, maybe not.

191
00:21:52,773 --> 00:21:55,313
It felt like it was looking for someone...

192
00:21:57,285 --> 00:22:00,055
If that is the case,
could it be looking for...

193
00:22:02,828 --> 00:22:04,678
Could it be looking for Eren?

194
00:22:06,145 --> 00:22:07,814
Eren?

195
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,140
Eren's with Squad Levi, which is
in charge of the right flank.

196
00:22:16,334 --> 00:22:17,614
The right flank?

197
00:22:19,188 --> 00:22:23,198
The plans I got had them
to the rear of the left flank.

198
00:22:26,942 --> 00:22:31,692
Mine said they were near
the front of the right...

199
00:22:34,725 --> 00:22:37,705
Wait, there's no way they'd
be on the front lines.

200
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:42,255
So where are they?

201
00:22:44,153 --> 00:22:47,383
Probably the safest place in the formation.

202
00:22:50,592 --> 00:22:54,502
Which means in the center,
and toward the rear...

203
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:58,205
Armin!

204
00:22:59,153 --> 00:23:01,553
There's no time to think.

205
00:23:03,142 --> 00:23:06,372
Smoke rounds can't possibly indicate
how much of a threat it poses!

206
00:23:08,849 --> 00:23:11,278
At this rate, it'll wipe out command.

207
00:23:12,479 --> 00:23:15,688
Then the formation will fall apart,
and that'll be the end.

208
00:23:17,275 --> 00:23:18,635
What are you trying to say?

209
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,369
In other words,

210
00:23:22,086 --> 00:23:24,956
at this range, we may still be
able to draw its attention.

211
00:23:27,166 --> 00:23:30,356
We may be able to buy time to withdraw.

212
00:23:32,768 --> 00:23:35,938
Maybe... Maybe...

213
00:23:40,791 --> 00:23:43,301
But it really is intelligent.

214
00:23:44,989 --> 00:23:48,648
To it, we are nothing but
insignificant insects.

215
00:23:50,457 --> 00:23:52,547
It'll just crush us...

216
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:55,258
Seriously?

217
00:23:57,957 --> 00:23:59,527
That's scary...

218
00:24:00,736 --> 00:24:03,735
Hey, are you really Jean?

219
00:24:05,218 --> 00:24:09,438
The Jean I know never thinks
of anyone but himself.

220
00:24:12,524 --> 00:24:14,394
Don't be an ass...

221
00:24:18,381 --> 00:24:23,091
I just don't want those charred bones I saw

222
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:28,150
to be disappointed in me!

223
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:32,160
I...

224
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:37,002
I know what I have to do now!

225
00:24:38,909 --> 00:24:41,828
And this is the job we chose.

226
00:24:43,271 --> 00:24:44,461
Help me!

227
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:55,059
Put on your hood.

228
00:24:55,806 --> 00:24:56,925
As far forward as you can...

229
00:24:57,479 --> 00:24:59,499
So that your face is hidden from it.

230
00:25:01,005 --> 00:25:05,614
I don't think it will kill us until
it knows who we are!

231
00:25:07,893 --> 00:25:09,073
Oh...

232
00:25:10,328 --> 00:25:13,688
You believe if it thinks we might
be Eren, it won't kill us?

233
00:25:16,035 --> 00:25:18,154
If nothing else, it'll make me feel better.

234
00:25:19,202 --> 00:25:22,322
Let's just hope it has poor eyesight!

235
00:25:25,074 --> 00:25:30,504
Armin, I thought it was creepy
how you always clung to Eren.

236
00:25:33,844 --> 00:25:35,524
But I've always thought you had it in you.

237
00:25:38,176 --> 00:25:39,696
Uh, thanks.

238
00:25:41,254 --> 00:25:43,964
But "creepy"? That's really mean...

239
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:09,950
It's going much more slowly
than when I first saw it.

240
00:26:11,852 --> 00:26:12,992
Is it tired?

241
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:17,370
If it runs at that speed
again, we'll be too late!

242
00:26:19,247 --> 00:26:22,097
Now's our chance... We have to do it now!

243
00:26:32,693 --> 00:26:35,673
Listen up... Remember what I said.

244
00:26:38,326 --> 00:26:40,815
Try to draw its attention
for as long as possible,

245
00:26:42,046 --> 00:26:44,415
to give the formation time to withdraw!

246
00:26:45,587 --> 00:26:47,797
Keep it here as long as you can.

247
00:26:50,427 --> 00:26:53,547
If we could cut its Achilles tendon,
that'd be more than enough.

248
00:26:55,567 --> 00:26:58,166
But don't do anything stupid...

249
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:00,851
Don't try to kill it!

250
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:05,020
It's aware of the weak spot on its neck.

251
00:27:06,921 --> 00:27:09,320
It's totally different than other Titans...

252
00:27:10,507 --> 00:27:12,097
It is impossible to kill.

253
00:27:13,525 --> 00:27:17,725
At least, not by any normal human being.

254
00:27:24,864 --> 00:27:25,834
However...

255
00:27:26,315 --> 00:27:28,574
If it's those two... Maybe...

256
00:28:31,463 --> 00:28:32,323
Armin!

257
00:28:36,428 --> 00:28:37,577
This one...

258
00:28:38,146 --> 00:28:40,445
Its movements are much more
precise than the others' are!

259
00:28:41,583 --> 00:28:42,672
Damn it.

260
00:28:43,211 --> 00:28:44,301
I...

261
00:28:45,258 --> 00:28:47,148
I underestimated it!

262
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:57,620
It protected its neck...

263
00:28:58,898 --> 00:28:59,588
Jean!

264
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,590
Damn it! I can't get away!

265
00:29:06,219 --> 00:29:07,139
I'm going to die!

266
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:10,220
Once it grasps my wire, it's over!

267
00:29:16,244 --> 00:29:17,253
Jean!

268
00:29:17,753 --> 00:29:20,743
Avenge the bastard who rushed to his death!

269
00:29:24,476 --> 00:29:25,466
Armin?

270
00:29:27,494 --> 00:29:29,164
It stopped?

271
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:31,840
That's the one...

272
00:29:32,349 --> 00:29:34,098
That's the one that killed him!

273
00:29:34,964 --> 00:29:37,763
He rushed to his death on the right flank!

274
00:29:39,147 --> 00:29:41,537
Avenge him!

275
00:29:52,728 --> 00:29:53,848
What happened?

276
00:29:55,641 --> 00:29:57,660
Did Armin hit his head and go insane?

277
00:29:58,659 --> 00:30:00,379
This isn't the time...

278
00:30:03,604 --> 00:30:04,544
R-Reiner?

279
00:30:06,308 --> 00:30:09,158
It crushed my best friend!

280
00:30:10,955 --> 00:30:13,655
I saw his body under its foot!

281
00:30:19,277 --> 00:30:21,287
He's going straight for the neck?

282
00:30:22,563 --> 00:30:24,042
No, it's working!

283
00:30:24,775 --> 00:30:27,445
While it's distracted by Armin!

284
00:30:40,537 --> 00:30:42,367
H-Hey...

285
00:31:02,682 --> 00:31:06,122
H-Hey... Reiner, you...

286
00:31:33,395 --> 00:31:35,635
Reiner did it!

287
00:31:37,235 --> 00:31:39,564
Mikasa was so strong, I forgot.

288
00:31:40,716 --> 00:31:43,896
But he's really strong and reliable, too...

289
00:31:46,707 --> 00:31:48,806
We've bought enough time, right?

290
00:31:49,844 --> 00:31:51,504
Let's get the hell away from it!

291
00:31:53,221 --> 00:31:56,871
If it isn't a man-eater,
it won't follow us!

292
00:32:11,239 --> 00:32:12,288
Look...

293
00:32:12,807 --> 00:32:17,107
That big bitch got scared
and decided to go home!

294
00:32:21,234 --> 00:32:22,734
No... Why?

295
00:32:24,491 --> 00:32:26,551
That's toward the center rear.

296
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,430
Is it

297
00:32:30,994 --> 00:32:32,714
heading toward Eren?

298
00:32:35,133 --> 00:32:38,329
